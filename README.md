## Category Manager
Category manager for Thunderbird contacts, also allows to send an email to all members of a category (category based contact groups).

This add-on scans all contact-cards of the currently selected addressbook, extracts all categories and displays a list inside the Thunderbird addressbook. It allows to rename and to remove a category (changes the category string in all member contact cards).
